### Process

It is recommended that you create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this project.

Make a virtual environment named "cvproject" by typing in your terminal:

You can replace "cvproject" with any name you like, however I like to keep the name of the virtual environment relevant to the project.

To activate your virtual environment, type in your terminal:

#### For Linux (bash)
```source cvproject/bin/activate```

#### For Windows Command Prompt
```venv\Scripts\activate```

#### For Windows PowerShell
```venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```

In order to install the required libraries run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
